# Lingona – Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
Lingona is an AI-powered speaking coach for Vietnamese learners of English. The product focuses on speaking practice first — pronunciation, scenario conversations, and exam speaking — with writing and grammar as future expansions. The core philosophy is "Open → Speak → Improve → See it" — users should be speaking within 10 seconds of opening the app.

Monorepo: `frontend/` (Next.js 14 + TS) and `backend/` (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL).

**Full technical roadmap:** `docs/technical-roadmap.md`
**Brand name:** Lingona (not "Lingora" — fix any remaining references)

  analytics                — Learning event log, heatmaps, observability
```

### Key Architecture Decision: No Separate AI Orchestration Layer
Conversation role-play is **core product logic**, not an AI add-on. The scenario engine (turn management, session state, scoring rubrics) lives inside `speaking/scenarios/` as a domain module. AI models are accessed through `providers/ai/` — same pattern as storage and speech providers. No separate "ClawDBot" or orchestration service until 10K+ DAU with real usage data.

---

## Architecture Philosophy — Modular Monolith

Lingona follows a **modular monolith** architecture. The system runs as a single deployable unit today, but code is structured with strict domain boundaries to enable future extraction into independent microservices when scale demands it.

### Principles

1. **Monolith now, microservices later** — All modules live in one codebase and share one PostgreSQL database. No premature service extraction until operational complexity justifies it (target: 50K+ DAU).
2. **Loose coupling between domains** — Each domain module (auth, speaking, writing, gamification, etc.) owns its own repositories, services, and controllers. Modules communicate through well-defined service interfaces, never by reaching into another module's repository directly.
3. **Provider abstraction** — All external infrastructure (object storage, speech APIs, AI scoring, payment providers) is accessed through service abstractions, never called directly from controllers or repositories. Swapping providers (e.g., AWS S3 → Cloudflare R2, Azure Speech → Google Speech) should require changing only the provider implementation, not the calling code.
4. **Clear DTOs** — Request and response shapes are defined as explicit types/interfaces. Controllers validate and transform HTTP input into domain DTOs before passing to services. Services never receive raw `req`/`res` objects.

### Domain Boundaries

| Domain | Owns | Boundary Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | Users, sessions, JWT tokens, roles | Other domains receive only `userId` from auth middleware — never query `users` table directly |
| `courses` | Course definitions, curriculum structure | Read-only reference data for other domains |
| `lessons` | Lesson content, vocab items, quiz items | Provides lesson metadata to progress and speaking domains via service calls |
| `progress` | User progress, scores, completion state | Consumes events from lesson completion; publishes to gamification |
| `gamification` | XP ledger, streaks, badges, leaderboard | Receives completion events from progress; fully self-contained scoring |
| `media` | Audio/image uploads, pre-signed URLs, storage | Provides upload/download URLs to speaking and writing domains; never stores domain-specific metadata |
| `speaking` | Pronunciation scoring, scenario sessions, exam sessions | Consumes media URLs for audio; calls external speech APIs through provider abstraction |
| `writing` | Grammar analysis, essay scoring, writing sessions | Calls external AI APIs through provider abstraction; stores evaluation results |

### Future Microservice Candidates

When scale or team structure justifies extraction, these are the likely first candidates:

| Service | Rationale | Extraction Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Media Service** | Audio/image uploads are I/O-heavy and benefit from independent scaling. Already designed to never proxy through the API server (pre-signed URLs). | High upload volume, CDN integration complexity |
| **Pronunciation Service** | Speech scoring involves long-running external API calls (Azure/Google Speech). Isolating prevents slow scoring from blocking the main API event loop. | Latency isolation, independent scaling of speech workload |
| **Learning Analytics Service** | XP ledger, learning events, and heatmap queries are append-heavy and read-heavy. Separating prevents analytics queries from impacting core lesson flow. | Write volume on `xp_ledger`/`learning_events`, complex reporting queries |
| **AI Evaluation Service** | Writing scoring and AI conversation share common LLM infrastructure. Bundling into one service allows shared prompt management and model routing. | Cost optimization, model version management |

### Design Rules

- **No cross-domain repository access** — A service in domain A must never `require()` a repository from domain B. Use the other domain's service layer instead.
- **Provider integrations are isolated** — Each external provider gets its own file (e.g., `providers/azureSpeech.js`, `providers/s3Storage.js`). The domain service imports a provider interface, not the SDK directly.
- **Service interfaces as contracts** — When domain A calls domain B's service, the function signature and return type serve as the contract. Document these in JSDoc.
- **No shared mutable state** — Domains do not share in-memory caches or singletons. Each domain manages its own state.
- **Database schema ownership** — Each domain owns its tables. Cross-domain queries (e.g., JOINs across `users` and `xp_ledger`) are only allowed in read-only analytics/reporting contexts, never in write paths.

## Post-Review Fixes (applied after Phase 1 architecture evaluation)

Two production bugs identified in the system design review and corrected before Phase 2:

### Fix 1 — Rate limiting behind Railway proxy (`app.js`)
**Problem:** `express-rate-limit` uses `req.ip` to count requests per client. Without
`app.set("trust proxy", 1)`, Express reports every request as coming from Railway's internal
proxy IP — making all users appear to share one IP address. In practice this means
10 requests from *anyone* exhaust the limit globally, then everyone is blocked.

**Fix:** Added `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` as the very first setting inside `createApp()`,
before any middleware registration. Express now reads the real client IP from the
`X-Forwarded-For` header set by Railway's reverse proxy.

```js
// backend/src/app.js
app.set("trust proxy", 1);   // ← added; must come before route registration
```

### Fix 2 — Guest migration atomicity (`progressRepository.js`)
**Problem:** `migrateGuestProgress` ran three independent `query()` calls sequentially
(merge, delete, soft-delete). A crash or DB error between any two steps would leave the
database in a partially-migrated state — progress rows potentially owned by both accounts.

**Fix:** Replaced the three bare `query()` calls with a dedicated `pool.connect()` client
executing `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`. All three mutations are now atomic — either all
succeed or the whole operation is rolled back.

```js
// backend/src/repositories/progressRepository.js
const client = await pool.connect();
try {
  await client.query("BEGIN");
  // ... merge, delete, soft-delete
  await client.query("COMMIT");
} catch (err) {
  await client.query("ROLLBACK");
  throw err;
} finally {
  client.release();
}
```

**External API behaviour:** Unchanged. Both fixes are internal implementation details with
no effect on request/response shapes, route paths, or calling code.

---

## Architecture Fixes (applied after Phase 4b architecture review)

Five issues identified in a full codebase architecture review and corrected:

### Fix 1 — Security: `completeLesson` userId derived from JWT, not body (`progressController.js`)
**Problem:** The endpoint accepted `userId` from `req.body`, allowing any authenticated user to record lesson completions (and earn XP/badges) on behalf of any other user's UUID.
**Fix:** `userId` is now always derived from `req.user.id` (the verified JWT token). The body field is ignored.

### Fix 2 — Error instances in all services (`scenarioService.js`, `pronunciationService.js`)
**Problem:** Services threw plain objects (`throw { status, message }`) which have no `.stack`. Sentry captures them as `[object Object]` with no usable trace.
**Fix:** All service throws now use proper Error instances with `.status` attached:
```js
const err = new Error("Scenario not found");
err.status = 404;
throw err;
```

### Fix 3 — `gamificationController` bypassed the service layer (`gamificationController.js`, `badgeService.js`)
**Problem:** Controller imported `badgeRepository` directly, skipping the service layer. Any future caching or validation on badge retrieval would be missed.
**Fix:** Added `listUserBadges(userId)` to `badgeService.js`. Controller now calls `badgeService.listUserBadges` instead of importing the repository directly.

### Fix 4 — Response envelope consistency (`gamificationController.js`, `leaderboardController.js`)
**Problem:** Both controllers called `res.json()` directly instead of `sendSuccess()`, producing a slightly different error shape (`data: null` field) than the rest of the API.
**Fix:** Both controllers now use `sendSuccess(res, {...})` and pass errors to `next(err)` for consistent handling by `errorMiddleware`.

### Fix 5 — Cross-domain repository access in `progressService.js`
**Problem:** `progressService` imported `xpRepository.getTotalXp` directly, crossing domain boundaries at the storage layer instead of calling the service layer.
**Fix:** Replaced `getTotalXp` import from the repository with `getXpSummary` from `xpService`. Also removed the now-redundant `computeLevel` call since `getXpSummary` already returns the computed level.

## Completed: Phase 4 — Scenario Speaking (Core Conversations)

**Goal:** User selects a scenario, has multi-turn AI conversation, gets session score.

**Approach:** Mock-first (same pattern as Phase 3). AI provider returns deterministic scripted responses; real OpenAI integration follows in Phase 4b.

Changes applied:
1. ✅ Migration 0006: `scenarios`, `scenario_sessions`, `conversation_turns` tables with CHECK constraints
2. ✅ AI provider factory — `providers/ai/aiProvider.js` + `mockAi.js` (category-specific response pools, deterministic scoring)
3. ✅ Scenario domain module — `scenarioRepository`, `scenarioService`, `scenarioController`, `scenarioRoutes`
4. ✅ Session lifecycle: start → submit turns (with mock AI response) → end with scoring (fluency, vocabulary, grammar, coach feedback, per-turn tips)
5. ✅ 12 scenario templates seeded across 6 categories (daily, food, travel, work, social, academic)
6. ✅ `ScenarioList` — category filter pills, difficulty badges, turn count, scenario cards
7. ✅ `ScenarioConversation` — full-screen chat overlay, optimistic UI, typing indicator, "End Chat" after 2+ user turns
8. ✅ `ScenarioSummary` — animated score circle (0→target ease-out), sub-score bars, coach feedback, turn-by-turn tips
9. ✅ Speak tab wired to real API data; homepage PracticeScenarios switches to Speak tab

**Completed in Phase 4b:**
- ✅ Real OpenAI provider (`openaiProvider.js`) using Responses API with 5s timeout + mock fallback
- ✅ IELTS Speaking mode — full 3-part simulation (Part 1 interview → Part 2 cue card + timers → Part 3 discussion)
- ✅ `IeltsConversation.tsx` — phase state machine, keyword + turn-cap detection, localStorage persistence, safe score defaults
- ✅ `IeltsTimer.tsx` — countdown timer (60s prep, 120s speaking), no memory leaks, onExpire once-only guard
- ✅ Migration 0007 — `exam_type` column on scenarios, IELTS scenario seeded

**Also completed in Phase 4b (after architecture review):**
- ✅ Real Azure Speech provider (`azureSpeech.js`) — pure REST API, no SDK, set `SPEECH_PROVIDER=azure` + `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` + `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`
- ✅ Voice input for IELTS — `useVoiceInput` hook (Web Speech API, Chrome/Edge), mic button in `IeltsConversation`, live transcript, auto-send on silence, text input fallback
- ✅ Speaking metrics — 30-day score trend via `GET /api/v1/users/:userId/pronunciation/metrics`, `useSpeakingMetrics` hook, `SpeakingMetrics` SVG chart component, wired into Profile tab

**Remaining in Phase 4b:**
- ⬜ Real Cloudflare R2 storage (`r2Storage.js`) — do when user has R2 credentials
- ⬜ Ensure audio stored as WAV for best Azure Speech accuracy (MediaRecorder records WebM by default)

**Also completed (product refinement pass):**
- ✅ Auth gate on exam/scenario features — guest users see "Sign in to start" prompt instead of cryptic "Session expired" error
- ✅ Improved error messages in `api.ts` — distinguishes "Please log in" (never had session) from "Session expired" (had session, lost it)
- ✅ ExamScreen login prompt banner for unauthenticated users
- ✅ IeltsConversation + ScenarioConversation error states show "Sign In" button when not authenticated
- ✅ Natural examiner delays (1.2–2.4s random pause before AI response appears) — feels human
- ✅ TTS auto-play for examiner questions (via `synthesizeSpeech` API) + auto-start mic after playback ends
- ✅ Exam room intro sequence ("Entering exam room...") instead of instant question
- ✅ Ending phase shows animated score bar analysis UI with 2.5s minimum display
- ✅ AnimatedBackground component — CSS-only gradient blobs (8-15s loops), 3 variants (expressive/subtle/minimal), center glow option
- ✅ Per-tab blob variants: home=expressive, speak/practice=subtle, exam=minimal
- ✅ ProfileScreen BadgeGrid type fix (`earnedAt` → `awarded_at` to match `Badge` type)
- ✅ Hero.tsx unescaped entities fix (build error)

---

## Completed: Phase 5 — AI Study Coach / "Today's Focus"

**Goal:** Help the user immediately know what to do next when they open the app. 1–2 high-impact recommendations, scannable in 3 seconds, coach feel.

**Architecture (strict separation of concerns):**
- `coachRepository.js` — data access only: counts, weakest prompt (with lessonId), recent sessions (with scenarioId) — 4 SQL queries
- `coachService.js` — rules engine: pure logic, no HTTP. Thresholds in named constants for easy tuning
- `coachController.js` — HTTP layer: UUID validation, ownership check, delegates to service
- `coachRoutes.js` — mounted at `/api/v1/users` alongside gamificationRoutes
- `useTodayFocus.ts` — React hook: fetch + cancel on unmount, errors logged via `console.warn`
- `TodayFocusCard.tsx` — positive empty state ("You're doing great today!"), colour-coded label pills per type

**Rules engine (priority order):**
1. **New user** (0 pronunciation + 0 scenarios) → "Start your first lesson" → Practice tab
2. **Weak pronunciation** (avg score on worst prompt < 75) → specific prompt with score + `lessonId` → Practice tab
3. **No recent scenarios** (last 7 days) → "No conversations this week" → Speak tab
4. **Low recent scenario avg** (< 60) → names the worst scenario + `scenarioId` for deep-link → Speak tab (or opens scenario directly)
5. Returns empty array if user is performing well → card shows positive empty state

**Deep linking:**
- `FocusRecommendation` carries optional `scenarioId` and `lessonId` fields
- Scenario deep-link: when `scenarioId` is present + actionTarget is `"speak"`, `handleFocusAction` fetches the scenario list, finds the match, and opens the conversation directly (bypasses ScenarioList browser)
- Pronunciation/lesson deep-link: `lessonId` is included for future auto-open (requires deeper component plumbing — TODO)
- All deep-links fall through to tab navigation on any error

**Error handling:**
- `api.ts` `getTodayFocus()` catches and logs errors via `console.warn`, returns `{ recommendations: [] }`
- `useTodayFocus` hook `.catch()` logs errors via `console.warn`
- `coachService.getFocusRecommendations()` catches DB errors, logs via `console.error`, returns `[]`
- UI always degrades gracefully — never crashes the homepage

**Extension points (built in, not used yet):**
- Thresholds (`WEAK_PRON_THRESHOLD`, `WEAK_SCENARIO_THRESHOLD`, `RECENT_SCENARIO_DAYS`) are named constants
- Each recommendation type has its own builder function — add new types without touching control flow
- `getFocusRecommendations()` never throws — LLM integration can replace or augment it later

**UX decisions:**
- Card appears between `StartSpeakingCard` and `PracticeScenarios` — after hero, before generic content
- Hidden while loading (no flash); shows positive empty state when no weak spots found
- Each row: label pill + title + description + action button (right-aligned)
- Action button deep-links to specific scenario when possible; falls back to tab navigation

---

## Completed: UI/UX Overhaul (between Phase 3 and Phase 4)

**Goal:** Transform Lingona from dashboard-style app to action-first AI speaking coach. Speaking-first, not content-browsing-first.

Changes applied:
1. ✅ CSS variables theme system — dark/light mode with `next-themes`, ~294 hardcoded color references migrated to CSS variables across 30+ files
2. ✅ Homepage redesign — `StartSpeakingCard` hero, `PracticeScenarios` (3 scenario cards), `CoachTipCard` (dismissible, non-blocking)
3. ✅ Navigation — replaced 8-item Sidebar with 4-item `BottomNav` (Home / Speak / Practice / Profile)
4. ✅ Topbar simplified — streak badge + "Lingona" brand + ThemeToggle + avatar (removed XP badge, search, notification bell, hamburger)
5. ✅ `SpeakingSection` redesign — conversation-thread layout with chat bubbles, scores hidden during live speaking (shown only on CompletionScreen)
6. ✅ Splash screen — logo + "LINGONA" text + loading bar (needs animated logo asset later)
7. ✅ Branding — text references updated from "Lingora" to "Lingona"

**Design principles locked:**
- Homepage guides to speaking in <10 seconds
- No XP-heavy UI on homepage
- Coaching tips are non-blocking (dismissible cards, not modals)
- Scoring stays out of live speaking flow
- Homepage stays minimal (~3-4 sections max, not a dashboard)

---

## Completed Phase: Phase 3 — Pronunciation Practice (Mock-First)

**Goal:** Audio upload, speech-to-text, and AI pronunciation scoring with phoneme-level feedback. Mock-first approach: mock providers ship first, real Cloudflare R2 + Azure Speech integration follows.

All tasks completed:
1. ✅ Migration `0005_pronunciation` — `pronunciation_attempts` table with JSONB phoneme/word details
2. ✅ Backend: Provider abstraction pattern — `providers/storage/` and `providers/speech/` with factory + interface docs
3. ✅ Backend: Mock storage provider — in-memory Map, localhost upload/download URLs, Express mock routes
4. ✅ Backend: Mock speech provider — deterministic scoring from reference text, phoneme decomposition
5. ✅ Backend: `mediaService.js` — pre-signed upload URL generation via storage provider
6. ✅ Backend: `pronunciationService.js` — orchestrates assessment: download URL → speech provider → persist attempt
7. ✅ Backend: `pronunciationRepository.js` — insert attempt, find best by lesson, find by prompt
8. ✅ Backend: `POST /api/v1/pronunciation/upload-url` — JWT protected, returns `{ uploadUrl, storageKey }`
9. ✅ Backend: `POST /api/v1/pronunciation/assess` — JWT protected, looks up reference text, returns phoneme feedback
10. ✅ Backend: `GET /api/v1/pronunciation/history/:promptId` — JWT protected, attempt history
11. ✅ Frontend: `AudioRecorder` component — browser MediaRecorder API, mic permission, pulsing recording UI
12. ✅ Frontend: `PronunciationResults` component — animated score circle, subscores, word pills, expandable phoneme detail
13. ✅ Frontend: `SpeakingSection` rewrite — per-prompt state machine (idle → recording → uploading → assessing → results)
14. ✅ Frontend: `LessonModal` — combined quiz + speaking scoring, passes lessonId/userId to SpeakingSection
15. ✅ Frontend: `CompletionScreen` — optional speaking score stat card alongside XP and quiz

**Exit criteria met:** User can record speech, upload audio (mock), receive pronunciation score + phoneme breakdown, retry per prompt, and see combined score on completion.

**Post-Phase 3 fix — Cross-domain query removal:**
- `pronunciationService.js` no longer imports `db.query()` or queries `speaking_prompts` directly
- Speaking prompt lookup now goes through `lessonService.getSpeakingPromptById()` → `lessonRepository.findSpeakingPromptById()`
- This enforces the "no cross-domain repository access" design rule

**Pending real provider integration (Phase 3b):**
- `providers/storage/r2Storage.js` — Cloudflare R2 with `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
- `providers/speech/azureSpeech.js` — Azure Speech SDK (`microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`)
- Env vars: `STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2`, `SPEECH_PROVIDER=azure` + R2/Azure credentials

---

## Completed Phase: Phase 2 — Gamification

**Goal:** Daily engagement loop with XP, streaks, badges, and leaderboard.

All tasks completed:
1. ✅ Migration `0003_gamification` — `xp_ledger`, `user_streaks`, `badges`, `user_badges`, `learning_events`
2. ✅ Migration `0004_fill_in_blank` — `question_type`, `correct_answer` columns on `quiz_items`
3. ✅ Backend: XP service — append-only `xp_ledger`, level computation from `LEVEL_THRESHOLDS`
4. ✅ Backend: Streak service — UTC calendar-day logic, longest streak tracking
5. ✅ Backend: Badge service — `first_lesson`, `streak_3`, `streak_7`, `streak_30`, `perfect_score`, `speed_demon`
6. ✅ Backend: Learning events — append-only log per lesson completion
7. ✅ Backend: `GET /api/v1/leaderboard?scope=weekly|all-time` — RANK() window function, optional auth
8. ✅ Backend: `GET /api/v1/users/:userId/gamification` — XP summary + streak + badges (JWT protected)
9. ✅ Backend: Wired gamification into `progressService.completeLesson` — XP, streak, badges, level-up detection
10. ✅ Frontend: `useGamification` + `useLeaderboard` hooks
11. ✅ Frontend: `XpProgressBar` — animated level fill bar
12. ✅ Frontend: `BadgeToast` — auto-dismiss notification on badge award
13. ✅ Frontend: `LevelUpModal` — full-screen celebration, auto-closes after 3s
14. ✅ Frontend: `LessonModal` — real XP, level-up modal, badge toast, streak stat on CompletionScreen
15. ✅ Frontend: `QuizSection` — fill-in-blank question type support
16. ✅ Frontend: Leaderboard page `/leaderboard` — scope tabs, medal emojis, "You" badge, myEntry
17. ✅ Frontend: Home page — real gamification data from `useGamification`, refetches after lesson

**Exit criteria met:** XP and streaks persist across devices. Leaderboard shows real rankings.

---

## Completed Phase: Phase 1 — Auth & Infrastructure

**Goal:** Secure, deployable foundation. Guest system migrates to real accounts.

Tasks in order:
1. ✅ Set up `node-pg-migrate` + migrations `0001_auth` + `0002_content_meta`
2. ✅ Backend: `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout`
3. ✅ Backend: `verifyToken` + `requireRole` middleware, progress routes protected
4. ✅ Frontend: Zustand `authStore`, `AuthProvider`, token refresh on 401, `useCurrentUserId`
5. ✅ Frontend: `/login` + `/register` pages, `ProtectedRoute` component
6. ✅ Frontend: guest UUID → real account migration on login/register
7. ✅ Deploy config: `railway.toml` + `next.config.mjs` API proxy rewrites + Sentry (`@sentry/node` backend, `@sentry/nextjs` frontend)

**Exit criteria:** A real user can create an account, log in, complete a lesson, and see their progress on page refresh.

## Architecture Decisions (locked — do not change without discussion)

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| JWT storage | `httpOnly` SameSite=Strict cookie for refresh token; access token in Zustand memory | Safest against XSS, no localStorage |
| XP system | Append-only `xp_ledger` table (never mutate `users.xp`) | Audit trail, retroactive awards, time-window leaderboards |
| DB migrations | `node-pg-migrate` | Needed from Phase 1 onward — no raw SQL files |
| Audio upload | Pre-signed S3/R2 URL — browser uploads directly, API only receives metadata | Never proxy large files through API server |
| Pronunciation scoring | Azure Speech API (pronunciation assessment) | Best phoneme-level feedback; abstracted behind `pronunciationService.js` |
| Writing evaluation | AI rubric scoring (e.g., IELTS band descriptors) | Consistent, explainable scores aligned to exam standards |
| State management | Zustand (add in Phase 1 for auth) | Lightweight, works with Next.js App Router |
| Monolith vs services | Stay monolith until 50K+ DAU. Exception: media never goes through API server | Premature extraction adds ops overhead |
| AI conversation provider | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via `providers/ai/` abstraction (mock-first) | Cost-effective; single model until data proves multi-model value |
| No AI orchestration layer | Scenario engine is core product logic in `speaking/scenarios/`, not a separate service | ClawDBot-style orchestration is premature; adds latency + failure modes |
| Theme system | CSS custom properties + `next-themes` for dark/light mode | SSR-safe, zero JS bundle cost, no heavy dependency |
| Frontend navigation | BottomNav (Home/Speak/Practice/Profile) — mobile-first | Action-first; replaces 8-item sidebar dashboard pattern |

### What changed from original roadmap and why
- **Exam Speaking** (was Phase 5) → merged into Phase 4b. It's a scenario template variant, not a separate backend phase.
- **AI Dialogue** (was Phase 9) → absorbed into Phase 4. Multi-turn AI conversation IS scenario speaking — not a separate feature.
- **Grammar & Writing** (were Phases 6–8) → pushed to Phase 8. Different skill domain; build after speaking is validated and monetized.
- **Classrooms** (was Phase 4 in technical-roadmap.md) → pushed to Phase 9. Needs proven product before B2B adoption.
- **AI Study Coach** (new Phase 5) → rules-based "what to practice next", addresses UX report without adding AI service complexity.
- **No ClawDBot orchestration layer** — premature at current stage. Revisit at 10K+ DAU.

## Code Patterns & Conventions

### Backend
- Layer order: `route → controller → service → repository` — no skipping layers
- All responses use the envelope: `{ success, message, data }`
- UUID validation in every controller before passing to service
- Repositories return plain objects only — no business logic
- Errors thrown as `{ status, message }` objects; caught by `errorMiddleware.js`
- Use `Promise.all()` for parallel DB queries in services

### Frontend
- API calls go through `lib/api.ts` only — no raw `fetch` in components
- Data fetching in custom hooks (`hooks/`) — never in components directly
- Types defined in `lib/types.ts` — keep in sync with API shapes
- Tailwind for all styling — no inline styles, no CSS modules
- Component files: PascalCase. Hook files: camelCase with `use` prefix

### Database
- All PKs are UUIDs
- All tables get `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()`
- Mutable tables get `updated_at` + trigger
- Soft deletes via `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULLABLE`
- Every schema change is a numbered `node-pg-migrate` migration file
